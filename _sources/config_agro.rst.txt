Configurating a Simulation
=============================

Agromanagement
--------------
The agromanagent files in ``/env_config/agro`` controls the underlying crop simulation in ``/pcse/`` by
loading different parameter sets for crops and sites. All Agromanagement files are written in YAML.
An agromanagement file consists of three parts.

File Heading
^^^^^^^^^^^^
Every agromanagement file must start with the heading ``Agromanagement:``

.. code-block:: text

    Agromanagement:

SiteCalendar
^^^^^^^^^^^^
After the Agromanagement Heading, there must be a valid ``SiteCalendar``, which looks like:

.. code-block:: text

    AgroManagement:
        SiteCalendar:
            latitude: 52
            longitude: 5
            year: 1984
            site_name: oregon
            site_variation: oregon_1
            site_start_date: 1985-01-01
            site_end_date: 1985-12-01

``latitude`` and ``longitude`` set the latitude and longitude of the site. Along with ``year``, ``latitude`` and ``longitude`` 
are used to load the historical weather for that ``latitude``, ``longitude`` and ``year`` using the `NASA Power API <https://github.com/kdmayer/nasa-power-api>`_.

* NOTE: the ``latitude``, ``longitude`` and ``year`` can be overridden in the ``env.reset()`` function or with the ``--npk-args.random-reset`` flag. 

``site_name`` and ``site_variation`` read the parameters from the ``env_config/site/site_name.yaml`` given the ``site_variation``. 

Check that the ``site_variation`` appears under the ``Variations`` header in the ``site_name.yaml`` file. For more information on site configuration. See here <TODO>.

``site_start_date`` and ``site_end_date`` set the global starting and ending dates of the simulation. The specifc year is almost always unimportant, as it will simply correlate to the length of the simulation in years.

* Example: setting ``site_start_date: 1985-01-01`` and ``site_end_date: 1985-12-01`` will result in the same output as setting  ``site_start_date: 2011-01-01`` and ``site_end_date: 2011-12-01``

* This is because on calling ``env.reset()`` the ``year`` is passed with the start month and day, and the difference between the ``site_start_date`` and ``site_end_date``. While this feels a bit clunky, it makes validation very easy.

CropCalendar
^^^^^^^^^^^^
In addition to the ``SiteCalendar``, there must be a valid ``CropCalendar``, which looks like:

.. code-block:: text

    CropCalendar:
        crop_name: wheat
        crop_variety: wheat_1
        crop_start_date: 1985-01-01
        crop_start_type: sowing
        crop_end_date: 1985-08-01
        crop_end_type: death
        max_duration: 365

``crop_name`` and ``crop_variety`` read the parameters from the ``env_config/crop/crop_name.yaml`` given the ``crop_variety``. 

Check that the ``crop_variety`` appears under the ``Varieties`` header in the ``crop_name.yaml`` file. For more information on site configuration. See here <TODO>.
   
``crop_start_date`` and ``crop_end_date`` set the dates that the crop starts and the maximum length of the crop. The ``crop_start_date`` must come after the ``site_start_date`` as a 
crop cannot be present without an active site, and the ``crop_end_date`` must happen before the ``site_end_date`` as there cannot be an active crop without an active site. 

The ``crop_start_type`` dictates the crop stage that the crop starts in. 
* For annual crops, valid start types are: ``sowing`` and ``emergence``.
* For perennial crops, valid start types are: ``sowing``, ``emergence`` and ``dormant``. 
* For grape specific simulations, specified by ``crop_name: grape``, valid start types are: ``endodorm`` and ``ecodorm``.

The ``crop_end_type`` controls the stage or trigger that the end the crop portion of the simulation
* For annual and perrennial crops, valid end types are: ``sowing``, ``emergence``, ``maturity``, ``harvest``, ``death``, and ``max_duration``.
* For grape specific simulations, valid end types are: ``endodorm``, ``ecodorm``, ``budbreak``, ``verasion``, ``ripe``, ``max_duration``.

``max_duration`` controls the maximum duration in days that a crop can be active. Regardless of the ``crop_end_type``, if the maximum duration is reached, the crop will become inactive, although the site simulation may continue.

* For more information on how crops and sites interact, see here <TODO>

Full Example
^^^^^^^^^^^^
After the three parts outlined above, a complete example would look like: 

.. code-block:: text

    AgroManagement:
        SiteCalendar:
            latitude: 52
            longitude: 5
            year: 1984
            site_name: oregon
            site_variation: oregon_1
            site_start_date: 1985-01-01
            site_end_date: 1985-12-01
        CropCalendar:
            crop_name: wheat
            crop_variety: wheat_1
            crop_start_date: 1985-01-01
            crop_start_type: sowing
            crop_end_date: 1985-08-01
            crop_end_type: death
            max_duration: 365
