WOFOST-Gym Documentation
=========================

WOFOST-Gym is a benchmark built using OpenAI's `Gymnasium <https://gymnasium.farama.org/index.html>`_ 
and `PCSE <https://pcse.readthedocs.io/en/stable/>`_ for crop yield agriculture simulations that spans annual and perennial crops. 
It natively supports training a variety of Reinforcement Learning Agents and generating data
for other RL problems including Offline RL, Off Policy Evaluation, and Transfer Learning.
